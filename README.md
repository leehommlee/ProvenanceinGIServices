# ProvenanceinGIServices

This is the ontology of the three-level view of provenance.

The three-level conceptual view of provenance (i.e., knowledge provenance, service provenance, and data provenance) corresponds to the three phases of automatic GIService composition: process modeling, process model instantiation, and workflow execution.   In the process modeling phase, the provenance is at the knowledge level, namely knowledge provenance.   It contains the data and service ontologies used, and process mod-els for complex process modeling.   A process model consists of the control flow and data flow among atomic processes.   The data flow focuses on the data exchange among atomic processes, while the control flow concerns the order in which atomic processes are exe-cuted.   An atomic process represents one type of the processing services that share the same functional behaviors such as functionality, input, and output.   Process models are based on the knowledge of domain modelers.   Such knowledge can be captured in the pro-cess and represented using ontologies, and be shared and reused by other domain modelers.   From this perspective, process models can be regarded as knowledge-oriented provenance.
